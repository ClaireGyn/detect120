**monitor the 120 Hz grid frequency with low cost equipment**

This repository collects the pipeline and some output from our experiments on studying the urban electrical grid's behavior through visible imaging monitoring at subsecond frequency. 
A single camera sited at an urban vantage point offers broad, persistent, real-time, and non-permissive coverage granular to individual housing units.

The 60 Hz AC line frequency of an electrical grid in the US induces a 120 Hz flicker in most of lights that it powers, in- cluding incandescent, halogen, transitional fluorescent, and some LED sources.1 This flicker is generally imperceptible to the unaided eye.
The 60 Hz line frequency is universal across the grid and maintained to within ∼ 0.02 Hz but the phase of the volt- age driving any particular light (and hence of its flicker) will depend upon the grid’s generating sources, topology and condition of its reactive components (e.g., distribution transformers), and the load local to the light.
